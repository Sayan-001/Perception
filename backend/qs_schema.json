      "question": "What is a Class?",
      "answer": "A class is a building block of Object Oriented Programs. It is a user-defined data type that contains the data members and member functions that operate on the data members. It is like a blueprint or template of objects having common properties and methods."
    },
    {
      "order": 2,
      "question": "What is Compile-Time Polymorphism?",
      "answer": "Compile time polymorphism, also known as static polymorphism or early binding is the type of polymorphism where the binding of the call to its code is done at the compile time. Method overloading or operator overloading are examples of compile-time polymorphism."
    },
    {
      "order": 3,
      "question": "What is the difference between overloading and overriding?",
      "answer": "A compile-time polymorphism feature called overloading allows an entity to have numerous implementations of the same name. Method overloading and operator overloading are two examples. Overriding is a form of runtime polymorphism where an entity with the same name but a different implementation is executed. It is implemented with the help of virtual functions."
    },
    {
      "order": 4,
      "question": "What is the virtual function?",
      "answer": "A virtual function is a function that is used to override a method of the parent class in the derived class. It is used to provide abstraction in a class."
