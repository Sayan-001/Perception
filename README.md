# Perception - AI-Powered Online Evaluation Portal

In todayâ€™s education landscape, **automated assessments** often fail to provide meaningful feedback for descriptive answers.
Even with the presence of AES (Automated Essay Grading), it works in open-world and hence, not Context specific, and does not provide any feedback.

**Perception** bridges this gap by leveraging **Contextual AI-powered evaluation**, ensuring that students receive **accurate, personalized, and constructive feedback**â€”just like a human evaluator.

## Features

### **For Students**

- View **pending** and **submitted** question sets.
- Answer **descriptive** questions within the portal.
- Receive **AI-generated feedback and scores** in real-time.

### **For Teachers**

- **Create** and **manage** question sets.
- Provide **model answers** to guide AI-based evaluation and obtain scores of students as evaluated by the LLM.
- **Review & finalize** AI-generated scores before submission.

### **AI-Based Evaluation**

- Uses **LLM** to **compare** student responses with teacher-provided answers.
- Provides **personalized feedback** and **suggestions** for improvement.
- Ensures **fair and unbiased** evaluation across all students by using pre-defined rules.
